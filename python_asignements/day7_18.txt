1. Write a program in Python to accept user input (strings) until user enters "end" and store that in file
(No need of string "end" to store). Read the contents of file through program and print the output.


while True:
	val = raw_input("Enter a string: ")
	fo = open("file.txt","a")
	fo.write(val)
	fo.write("\n")
	if val == "end":
		exit()
	

3. Write a program in Python to perform the following:
 Write a function count_words_in_file() to return number of whitespace separated words in a
given file
 Write a function sum_numbers_in_file() to return sum of numbers (integers separated by white
space) in a given file


#!/usr/bin/python

num_lines = 0
num_words = 0
num_chars = 0

fa = open("file2.txt","r")
for line in fa:
	words = line.split()

	num_lines += 1
    	num_words += len(words)
    	num_chars += len(line)
print num_chars
print num_words
print num_lines


4. Write a program in Python to implement command line arguments with options. This has to be
something like this.
Generate a file called input.txt (or whatever required name), this has to have one number each line.
Read the contents of file, sum the numbers and display the sum in the file as provided by user (say
output.txt). User has to execute the program as following
$ ./find_sum_from_files –i input.txt –o output.txt
If user not enters other than i and o options with values or with –h, display help message such as for
all the below cases
$ ./find_sum_from_files –i
$ ./find_sum_from_files –i input.txt
$ ./find_sum_from_files –i input.txt -o
$ ./find_sum_from_files –o output.txt
$ ./find_sum_from_files –h
$ ./find_sum_from_files –x
Handle errors or invalid inputs using exceptions.


#!/usr/bin/python
import sys,getopt

def main(argv):
	inputfile = ''
	outputfile = ''
	try: 
		opts,args = getopt.getopt(argv,"hi:o:",["ifile=","ofile="])
	except getopt.GetoptError:
		print 'getopts_test.py -i <inputfile> -o <ouputfile>'
		sys.exit(2)
	for opt,arg in opts:
		if opt == '-h':
			print 'usage: getopts_test.py -i<inputfile> -o<outputfile>'
			sys.exit()
		elif opt in ("-i","__ifile"):
			inputfile= arg
		elif opt in ("-o","__ofile"):
			outputfile = arg
	print 'input file  is ',inputfile
	print 'output file is',outputfile
	return
if __name__ == '__main__':
	main(sys.argv[1:])
 







5. Write a program in Python to read a sample csv file and print the values

import csv
fa = open("file.csv","rb")
readcsv = csv.reader(fa)
for row in readcsv:
	print row

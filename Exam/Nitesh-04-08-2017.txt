ANS: 

for i in range(0,6):

	print i



6.Given an array of ints length 3, return an array with the elements "rotated left" so {1, 2, 3} yields {2, 3, 1}.

rotate_left3([1, 2, 3]) → [2, 3, 1]
rotate_left3([5, 11, 9]) → [11, 9, 5]
rotate_left3([7, 0, 0]) → [0, 0, 7]

ANS:





7.Count the number of "xx" in the given string. We'll say that overlapping is allowed, so "xxx" contains 2 "xx".

countXX("abcxx") → 1
countXX("xxx") → 2
countXX("xxxx") → 3

count = -1
for i in ("abxx"):
	if i == "x":
		count += 1
print count

count = -1
for i in ("xxx"):
	if i == "x":
		count += 1
print count

count = -1
for i in ("xxxx"):
	if i == "x":
		count += 1
print count
